Combining code and prose

Knuth "literate programming"

Now common place in documenting code

Model flipped with "data science notebooks."

Look at PDF "50YearsDataScience"

Knuth coined the phrase “literate programming.” I’d like to reverse that.  Metaphor of weave.  But noun/focus is programming, and expository prose woven around that.

I’d like to reverse that.  Noun/focus is expository writing, and programmed or machine-actionable objects are woven around that.

One example is semantic citation within a text. (CITE URNs).

One of the most remarkable illustrations is org-babel mode.

Here is org-babel: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/

I used that with lilypond.

Here is org-babel-lilypond. http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-lilypond.html

It might be “only” typesetting but it’s very cool.  You’ve got a semantic description of an object embedded in your org-mode text.

## Install notes?

Anything beyond what’s on web sites?

## How-to notes

+ Compile a block of lilypond code:  Ctl-c Ctl-c

+ Generate pdf of your document:  Ctc-c Ctl-e, then P for pdf



## Working environments





As I've commented before, [Julia is my go-to language for scholarly work](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/posts/2024-10-22-why-julia/index.html).


Quarto is so cool!

Pluto notebooks are so cool!
