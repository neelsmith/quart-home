The Homer Multitext project (HMT) has made its [digital photography of manuscripts](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/hmt/images/) of the *Iliad* with scholia available online since 2007. Since 2017, we have published periodic releases of all the project's work in a single, massive plain-text file. These published datasets have always included catalogs of the project's digital images, and datasets relating the images to the manuscript pages they document. We're now beginning to add a third form of publication: extracts from the published datasets in the format of the IIIF Presentation Manifest.

## What's included


- simple model of codex:

label, sequence, rv

image/page relatd by urns

basis for releated citable texts to physical support



## How we do it


The `HmtArchive.jl` package can work

- release has always built Codex objects
- new pkg works directly with them

As good as the codex model!


## Next steps

Now 3 publications.

1. the archive release (plain text)
2. binary image data on 
3. the IIIF manifests

Can begin to review image data for other MSS and accuracy of codex models.
