The Homer Multitext project (HMT) has made its [digital photography of manuscripts](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/hmt/images/) of the *Iliad* with scholia available online since 2007. Since 2017, we have published periodic releases of all the project's work in a single, massive plain-text file. These published datasets have always included catalogs of the project's digital images, and datasets relating the images to the manuscript pages they document. We're now beginning to add a third form of publication: extracts from the published datasets in the format of the IIIF Presentation Manifest.

## What's included


The HMT's data model for a codex manuscript is simple. It's a sequence of pages, each documented with a sequence number, identification as recto or verso, a full human-readable label, and a pair of CITE URNs associating identifiers for the physical page and the documentary image used to catalog the page.

With this simple model, we can easily relate other citable content (most notably edited passages of the *Iliad* and scholia) to navigable views of a manuscript.

The [IIIF's Presentation model](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) has overlapping goals. Its elaborate JSON structure lets you define a series of canvases, on which you can place "annotation pages" that can include annotations such as images to place on the canvas. Many [IIIF viewers](https://iiif.io/get-started/iiif-viewers/) support navigating a series of images documented in a IIIF manifest. The new manifests for HMT manuscripts label images with the data of our simple codex model.

## How we do it


The `HmtArchive.jl` package can work

- release has always built Codex objects
- new pkg works directly with them

As good as the codex model!



Folio 12 recto in codex model:

```
sequence|urn|rv|label|image
23|urn:cite2:hmt:msA.v1:12r|recto|Venetus A (Marciana 454 = 822), folio 12, recto|urn:cite2:hmt:vaimg.2017a:VA012RN_0013
```

In IIIF:

```{json}

                }
            ]
        }
        ]
    }
```




## Next steps

Today we're publishing a manifest for the uniquely important Venetus A manuscript (Marciana 454 = 822).


Now 3 publications.

1. the archive release (plain text)
2. binary image data on 
3. the IIIF manifests

Can begin to review image data for other MSS and accuracy of codex models.
