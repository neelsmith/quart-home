## Updated IIIF manifests

- initial manifest was just to make sense of images not cataloged on LoC. (See here: https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/posts/2024-11-13-complutensian-iiif/index.html)

- since then, have completed quire analysis of all 6 volumes.

- updated versions of main manifests for each volume identify pages by quire/page

- did this with new version of `CitablePhysicalText` package: genreated directly from codex model.

- this means: every image tested!
