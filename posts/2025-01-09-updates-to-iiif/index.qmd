## Why

I first cobbled together IIIF manifests for each of the six volumes of the Computensian Bible so that I could browse and try to make sense of the images that were not documented on the web site where the Library of Congress published the openly licensed images. (Here's [the complicated story](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/posts/2024-11-13-complutensian-iiif/index.html).)

I've updated the IIIF manifests to address a second challenge for anyone  studying the Complutensian Bible. While all copies have essentially the same contents in each volume, they order the various sections of reference material in volumes 5 and 6 differently. In fact, of the seven copies I have been able to examine, each has a unique sequence of pages in volume 6!   Refering to pages by sequential page number wouldn't make sense.

I have been able to complete a quire analysis of all six volumes. Most of the Complutensian was printed in ternions, or groups of three sheets. Each sheet is a double folio, so when stacked in a gather, or quire, of three sheets, each quire has six folios. Each folio has a front (recto) and back (verso) side -- what we would consider a printed page, so the six folios of each ternion comprise twelve pages.


 and have now updated the manifests to identify 

- since then, have completed quire analysis of all 6 volumes.

- updated versions of main manifests for each volume identify pages by quire/page


## How

- did this with new version of `CitablePhysicalText` package: genreated directly from codex model.

- this means: every image tested!
