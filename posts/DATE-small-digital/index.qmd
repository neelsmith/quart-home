## Scholarly work and "small-digital" projects

In academia, "digital humanities" has become almost ynonymous with big, grant-funded, multi-year projects. Some of these projects have succeeded in creating foundational resources for digital scholarship. (For one example, I'll be posting soon about the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io), or IIIF.) But what I'll call "small digital" work is essential if we hope to realize the potential of digital scholarship.

- define small digital:

small team or individual
minimal tech infrastructure
easily shared and rep
licated
model of

- value of small digital



But limiting our digital work *exclusively* to big projects misses out on some of the most significant advantages of digital scholarship.
