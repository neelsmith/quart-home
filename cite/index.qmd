This page will fundamental ideas about scholarly citation using digital resources.

Overview:

- scholarship in the humanities starts from citation: we study specific, unique examples of cultural material
- citation expresses a semantic model of different types of content

The right technology for this is the [URN](../cite/urns/).

Much of my work with [digital texts](../digitexts/) considers texts contents in relation to the physical artifacts preserving the text. For this work, citation models:

- passages of [texts](../cite/urns/cts.qmd) (CTS URNs)
- physical [artifacts](../cite/urns/cite2.qmd) (CITE2 URNs)
- documentary [images](../cite/urns/imgs.qmd) (CITE2 URNs, including extension for region of interest on an image)
