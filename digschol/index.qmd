## Digital scholarship: concepts and code

The digital scholarship linked here has an overall logic: there is a natural sequence progressing from citation, to successsive forms of textual manipulation and analysis, to applications of those concepts.

You can 


I've chosen to present them together with documentation and tutorials using implementations of the concepts, because I don't believe that we can adequately assess or critique ideas about digital scholarship without running code.


## Concepts

- Here's [the narrative sequence](./narrative/)

## Julia packages

- [Graph of package dependencies](./pkg_graph/)




The topics in the "Concepts and code" section form a natural sequence,  Linked information includes fuller narrative presentations of concepts that could be read sequentially like a book, but 



All code in the linked sections is in written  [Julia](../julia/).

### Fundamentals: citation and textual analysis



- [citation](../cite/)
- [digital texts](../digitexts/)
- a simple illustration: a brief notebook using Julia to apply ideas about citation and digital texts to [the American Declaration of Independence](../walkthrough/).

### Applications 

- the [Homer Mulitext project](../hmt/): Julia packages and some applications.
- [semantic editions](../semantic-editions/) of texts.  




### Utilities

A few other Julia packages for [various generic tasks](../utils/).
