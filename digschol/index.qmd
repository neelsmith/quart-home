A selection of some work I'm currently developing or maintaining.



## Concepts and code

:::{.callout-note}
The fuller information for each of the links in this section includes narrative presentation of concepts. These could be read sequentially like a book, but I've chosen to present them together with documentation and tutorials using implementations of the concepts.

All the code in the linked sections is in Julia.

## Semantic editions of texts

Manuscripts:

- how they're managed, served, sources


List some examples:

- Tools for multilingual reading: the Complutensian polyglot Bible
- Datasets for geographic maps: Ptolemy, *Geography*: 
- Precomputed mathematical functions: Ptolemy, *Almagest*: 
- Proofs with mathematical figures: Euclid, *Geometry*; Archimedes, *Spiral Lines*
- Grammatical inflectional tables
- Chronological computation: Jerome's *Chronicles*
- Documents with ancient Greek musical notation
- Manuscripts with musical notation in neumes

Lexica:

- LSJMining.jl
- LexiconMining.jl

## Odds and ends

- Vector alignments
