## Digital scholarship: concepts and code

The digital scholarship presented here has an overall logic: there is a natural progression from citation, to successsive forms of textual manipulation and analysis, to applications of those concepts.

While the discussion of this work could be read in a single sequence like a book, I've chosen to compose it in separate sections integrated within documentation of Julia packages implementing the concepts under discussion, since I don't believe that we can ever adequately assess or critique ideas about digital scholarship without running code.  I'm trying to have it both ways by linking together a sequence of the prose presentations that you can follow in something more like a single narrative.





## (1) Concepts

- read about the  concepts underlying this digital work in a [single narrative sequence](./narrative/)

## (2) Code

All code linked from the following sections is  written in  [Julia](../julia/).   Documentation for each Julia package includes tutorials, "how-to" guides for particular tasks, and API documentation. The documentation was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), so that all  examples of code output are generated from running source code, and all API documentation is extracted from the package's source code.

- see a [graph showing relations](./pkg_graph/) among these packages.

### Fundamentals: citation and textual analysis



- [citation](../cite/)
- [digital texts](../digitexts/)
- a simple illustration: a brief notebook using Julia to apply ideas about citation and digital texts to [the American Declaration of Independence](../walkthrough/).

### Applications 

- the [Homer Mulitext project](../hmt/): Julia packages and some applications.
- [semantic editions](../semantic-editions/) of texts.  




### Utilities

A few other Julia packages for [various generic tasks](../utils/).
