:::{.callout-important}
Under each heading, links lead to futher information including narrative presentation of concepts. While these could be read sequentially like a book, I've chosen to present them together with documentation and tutorials using implementations of the concepts, because I think that we can't adequately assess or critique ideas about digital scholarship running code.

All code in the linked sections is in [Julia](../julia.qmd).

## Concepts and code



Scholarship in the humanities depends on **citation** to identify its unique objects of study. This section presents work on technology-independent citation using URNs.

All analysis of **digital texts** must take account of how the text's writing system, or *orthography*, is digitally encoded, and how we can derive *citable digital editions* from sources in a variety of structured text formats. *Morphological parsing* is especially important for the morphologically rich languages I study.

The **Homer Multitext project** has allowed me to apply these ideas to a significant corpus of manuscript material.

## Semantic editions of texts








List some examples:

- Tools for multilingual reading: the Complutensian polyglot Bible
- Datasets for geographic maps: Ptolemy, *Geography*: 
- Precomputed mathematical functions: Ptolemy, *Almagest*: 
- Proofs with mathematical figures: Euclid, *Geometry*; Archimedes, *Spiral Lines*
- Grammatical inflectional tables
- Chronological computation: Jerome's *Chronicles*
- Documents with ancient Greek musical notation
- Manuscripts with musical notation in neumes
