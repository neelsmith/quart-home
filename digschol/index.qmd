A selection of some work I'm currently developing or maintaining.



## Concepts and code


:::{.callout-note}
Under each heading, links lead to futher information including narrative presentation of concepts. While these could be read sequentially like a book, I've chosen to present them together with documentation and tutorials using implementations of the concepts.

All code in the linked sections is in [Julia](../julia.qmd).

Scholarship in the humanities depends on *citation* to identify its unique objects of study. This section presents work on technology-independent citation using URNs.

All analysis of digital texts must take account of *orthography* in order to perform the basic tasks like tokenization. This section

## Semantic editions of texts

Digital scholarly editions

- images, physical artifacts, text content
- how they're managed, served, sources


List some examples:

- Tools for multilingual reading: the Complutensian polyglot Bible
- Datasets for geographic maps: Ptolemy, *Geography*: 
- Precomputed mathematical functions: Ptolemy, *Almagest*: 
- Proofs with mathematical figures: Euclid, *Geometry*; Archimedes, *Spiral Lines*
- Grammatical inflectional tables
- Chronological computation: Jerome's *Chronicles*
- Documents with ancient Greek musical notation
- Manuscripts with musical notation in neumes
