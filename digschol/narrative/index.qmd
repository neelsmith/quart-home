## Citation


::: {.callout-tip title="Summary"}
Scholarship in the humanities depends on **citation** to identify its unique objects of study. This section presents work on technology-independent citation using URNs: passages of texts (implemented with CTS URNs), physical artifacts (CITE2 URNs) and documentary images (CITE2 URNs, including extension for region of interest on an image)

- [Citing texts](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/citablebase/concepts/) (the `CitableText` package)
- Citing artifacts
- Citing images

    

## Digital texts

::: {.callout-tip title="Summary"}
All analysis of **digital texts** must take account of how the text's writing system, or *orthography*, is digitally encoded, and how we can derive *citable digital editions* from sources in a variety of structured text formats. I'm interested in digital *scholarly editions of physical texts* that encode both textual and non-textual contents.
