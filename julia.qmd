title: "Why Julia?"
---

I started using Julia in 2021 because of Pluto notebooks.

A few reasons it's become my language of choice:

- I don't spend time trying to manage versions and environments
- It runs everywhere
- It's fast
- Twenty-first century features are part of the language, not add-ons: mature handling of Unicode, built-in support for unit testing, many other features
- Productive working environment (Pluto, VS Code including options like Quarto)
