## Content incomplete

This page will introduce digital encodings of orthographic systems.
:::


We can't read a text until we understand its writing system; we can't meaningfully work with a digital text until we understand how its writing system is encoded digitally.

Problems:

- conflation of language and writing system!
- naive generalizations from a single language (especially English)
- hacks to work around problems that should follow automatically from a well defined digital orthographic system

Concepts introduced and a functional interface in Julia defined in the `Orthography.jl` package.
