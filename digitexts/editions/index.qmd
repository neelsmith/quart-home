title: "Building citable editions from structured text sources"
---

Two abstractions developed at HC MID allow us to go from multivalent sources to computationally analyzable univocal editions in two steps:


1. *make structured sources citable*: map structured sources to canonical CTS URNs.
2. *edition builders*:  given a citable structured source, compose specified types of editions that can be computationally analyzed without any further structure than citation by URN.
