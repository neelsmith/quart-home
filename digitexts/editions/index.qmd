This page will introduce turning structured text sources into citable digital editions,
and working with citable corpora.
:::


Two abstractions developed at HC MID allow us to go from multivalent sources to computationally analyzable univocal editions in two steps:


1. *make structured sources citable*: map structured sources to canonical CTS URNs.
2. *edition builders*:  given a citable structured source, compose specified types of editions that can be computationally analyzed without any further structure than citation by URN.

We can use a *citable corpus* together with an [orthography](../orthography/) for higher-order manipulation and analysis.
