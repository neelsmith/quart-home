This page will introduce building specified editions from a citable multivalent source.

Build specific *univocal editions* (diplomatic, normalized in various ways...)

I use the term "univocal edition" to refer to an edition that makes a single version of the text with specified semantics available via canonical citation: text content can be directly analyzed without further knowledge of the source document's format.
