# Update to interactive Lewis-Short

The github repository at [https://github.com/neelsmith/lewis-short](https://github.com/neelsmith/lewis-short) includes a Pluto notebook and a script you can load in the Julia REPL to work with a digital Lewis and Short *Latin Dictionary*.

## Changes and current versions numbers

- easier options for using the REPL offline with a previously downloaded dataset
- options in both REPL script and Pluto notebook for counting results rather than formatting the full text of matching articles in Markdown

Current versions:

- Pluto notebook: 1.2.0
- script for use in REPL: 1.3.0
