## Changes

The Homer Multitext project's published IIIF manifestsnow cover three manuscripts of the *Iliad* with scholia. Use any of the following links with an IIIF viewer:


- [the Venetus A](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive/refs/heads/master/iiif/venetusA.json)
- [Venice, Biblioteca Marciana 841](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive/refs/heads/master/iiif/marciana_841.json)
- [British Museum, Burney 86](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive/refs/heads/master/iiif/burney86.json) ("the Townley Homer")
