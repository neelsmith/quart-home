## Release notes: version 0.3.0

- Version `0.3.0` (now available on the main branch of the github repository) is a complete reworking of the previous package. It uses ChatGPT to extract morphological information from Lewis-Short's *Latin Dictionary*, parses the ChatGPT output into an object model, and from those objects  generates data usable with the Tabulae system for building Latin morphological parsers.
