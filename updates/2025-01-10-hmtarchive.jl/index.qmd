## Release notes: version 0.16.1

- adds support for yesterday's update to `CitablePhysicalImage.jl` which introduced the `iiifmanifest` function. 


::: {.callout-note}
The package's `hmt_codices` function returns a list of `Codex` objects from the most recent published release of the HMT archive. With an image service and configuration for a manifest, you can now create IIIF manifests directly from a codex in this list.
