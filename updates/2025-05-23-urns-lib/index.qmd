## New package announcement: `urn-lib.js`

### Summary and motivation


`urn-lib.js` is a javascript library for parsing, validating, comparing, and retrieving data associated with CTS (Canonical Text Services) URNs and CITE2 URNs.



## Release notes

Initial release. Main features:

- analyze and manipulate CTS URNs and CITE2 URNs
- comparison of CTS URNs and CITE2 URNs based on equality or URN congruence
- retrieve data from delimited-text sources based on URN congruence




## Installation

The file `urn-lib.js` can be downloaded from github and used locally, or loaded vis jsDelivr from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/neelsmith/urns-lib/urn-lib.js`.

## Documentation

## Source

## Caveats

The javascript library and the markdown documentation were written entirely by gemini-2.5-pro. The code passes a series of sanity tests, but I have not even looked at the javascript. When I encountered errors, I let gemini fix them. Use the code as you like, but be aware that I have no idea what it does or how it works.


Auditing the build:

- github repository includes a complete transcript of the chat used to generate the script, with saved intermediate versions of the javascript library. See the repository [README](https://github.com/neelsmith/urns-lib) for details.
