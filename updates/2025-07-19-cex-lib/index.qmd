## New package announcement: `cex.js`

### Summary and motivation

`cex.js` is a javascript library for working with CEX data sources in a web browser or other javascript environment.

The Homer Multitext project publishes its data releases in a single, plain-text document on github. (The current release is always available at [this URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive/refs/heads/master/releases-cex/hmt-current.cex).) The release file follows the Cite EXchange format (CEX), defined [here](https://cite-architecture.github.io/citedx/CEX-spec-3.0.1/).

The javascript library in `cex.js` simplifies working with CEX data in a web browser or other javascript environment.

## Release notes

Initial release. Main features:

- load and parse CEX data from string values, local files or URLs
- discover CEX block labels, read contents of blocks by label
- discover data models, and find collections implementing a model
- retrieve a delimited-text table for the contents of all blocks of a given type

## Caveats

The javascript library and the markdown documentation were written entirely by gemini-2.5-pro. The code passes a series of sanity tests, but I have not even looked at the javascript. When I encountered errors, I let gemini fix them. Use the code as you like, but be aware that I have no idea what it does or how it works.
