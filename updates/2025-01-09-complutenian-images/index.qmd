## Changes

As part of my project on [the Complutensian Polyglot Bible](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/digitalcomplutensian/), I have mirrored the images of the copy in the National Library of Spain on a IIIF server at the University of Houston. The collection now includes 100% of the documented images.


## Documentation

The images are documented in six IIIF manifests, one for each volume.

- [links to the IIIF manifests](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/digitalcomplutensian/resources/images/)


### Generating the manifests


The manifests are generated from codex models of the six volumes of the Complutensian in [this github repository](https://github.com/neelsmith/complutensian-texts) via 
a Julia script using the `CitablePhysicalText` package. (See a tutorial from the package documentation on [generating IIIF manifests](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/citablephysicaltext/tutorials/iiif.html).) The following Julia code generates the manifests from the same data.

First, we follow the tutorial to instantiate an image service, configure settings for the IIIF manifests, and read in the codex model.



```{julia}
#| include: false
repo = joinpath(pwd() |> dirname |> dirname |> dirname, "complutensian-texts")
```
```{julia}
#| include: false
using Pkg
Pkg.add("CitablePhysicalText")
Pkg.add("CitableBase")
Pkg.add("CitableImage")
```
```{julia}
using CitablePhysicalText, CitableBase
using CitableImage

imgsvc_baseurl = "http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv"
imgsvc_root = "/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom"
imgsvc = IIIFservice(imgsvc_baseurl, imgsvc_root)

manifestids = ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/complutensian-texts/refs/heads/main/iiif/complutensian-bne-v$(i)-manifest.json" for i in 1:6]
configs = iiifconfig.(manifestids)


codexurls = ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/complutensian-texts/refs/heads/main/codex/bne_v$(i).cex" for i in 1:6]
#codexfiles = [joinpath(repo, "codex", "bne_v$(i).cex") for i in 1:6]
codices = [fromcex(f, Codex, UrlReader)[1] for f in codexurls]

totalpages = [length(c.pages) for c in codices] |> sum
@info("Total pages documented in manifests: $(totalpages)")
```

Then generating the manifests is a one-ilner.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
manifests = [iiifmanifest(codices[i], configs[i], imgsvc) for i in 1:6]
```
