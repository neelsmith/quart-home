## New package announcement

`OpenScripturesHebrew.jl` is a Julia package for working with the morphological data of the [Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible project](https://hb.openscriptures.org) (OSHB). `OpenScripturesHebrew.jl` parses the OSHB data into easily manipulated Julia tuples, and provides a Julia data model for the OSHB morphological data.


## Release notes: version `0.1.0`

- download and parse OSHB annotations for all or specified portions of the Hebrew Bible (more than 423,000 individually annotated words)
- all words keyed to canonically identified passages using CTS URNss
- can instantiate Julia objects from OSHB morphological codes for Hebrew morphology


## Installation

Install from the central registry with Julia's package manager. 

- in package mode from the Julia REPL `] add OpenScripturesHebrew`
- from a Julia terminal session: `using Pkg; Pkg.add("OpenScripturesHebrew")`
