## Caveats

The javascript library and the markdown documentation were written entirely by gemini-2.5-pro. The code passes a series of sanity tests, but I have not even looked at the javascript. When I encountered errors, I let gemini fix them. Use the code as you like, but be aware that I have no idea what it does or how it works.


## Auditing the build:

- github repository includes a complete transcript of the chat used to generate the script, with saved intermediate versions of the javascript library. See the repository [README](https://github.com/neelsmith/greeklib) for details.
