# Current projects


I'm actively working on:

- a [digital Complutensian polyglot Bible](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/digitalcomplutensian): digital resources for both experts and novices, supporting aligned multilingual reading 
- the [Homer Multitext project](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/hmt/):  a personal site about how I work with the Homer Multitext projectâ€™s digital archive


I've done extensive preparatory work for a project I plan to return to in 2025:

- "[semantic editions](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/semanticeditions/)": digital editions of texts with significant non-textual material
