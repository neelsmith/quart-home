# Current projects

Some projects I'm currently working on:


- a [digital Complutensian polyglot Bible](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/digitalcomplutensian): digital resources for both experts and novices, supporting aligned multilingual reading 
- "[semantic editions](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/semanticeditions/)": digital editions of texts with significant non-textual material
- the [Homer Multitext project](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/hmt/):  a personal site about how I work with the Homer Multitext projetâ€™s digital archive
