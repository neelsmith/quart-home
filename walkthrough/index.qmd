## Background and sources

The historian and classicist Danielle Allen offers a new interpretation of the American Declaration of Independence that is literally based on a new reading: she punctuates the text differently from most printed editions. (See her book [@allen2014] and the subsequent manuscript available from the Institute for Advanced Study [@allen2015].)

This page briefly illustrates how we could apply the Julia packages for citation and for working with digital texts to the problem of reading the text of the Declaration.

### Sources

1.  The U.S. National Archives has published freely available, high-resolution images of both the original signed parchment, and a widely used engraved reproduction. (See the presentation of the Declaration of Independence from the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration), with links to [downloadable images](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/downloads)) These images have been added to the Homer Multitext project's citable image service.
2.  Two transcriptions of the text in TEI-compliant XML are included in this site's github repository:
    -   [transcription 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/quart-home/main/walkthrough/adoi/declaration_engraving.xml): a transcription of the text of the engraving, taken from [this page](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript) of the National Archives web site
    -   [transcription 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/quart-home/main/walkthrough/adoi/declaration_original.xml): a transcription of the text from the image of the original parchment
3.  The relations of text, pages and documentary image are documented in a delimited-text file in this site's github repository [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/quart-home/main/walkthrough/adoi/declaration.cex).

## Citation with URNs

### Citing texts

Cite the text of the original and the engraving using `CtsUrn`s with different version identifiers.

```{julia}
using CitableBase, CitableText
engraving_text = CtsUrn("urn:cts:citeusnatarch:foundingdocuments.declindep.engraving:")
original_text = CtsUrn("urn:cts:citeusnatarch:foundingdocuments.declindep.original:")
```

:::

### Citing objects

Identify a collection of pages (front and back) for the original and for the engraving using `Cite2Urn`s.

```{julia}
using CitableObject
engraving_pages = Cite2Urn("urn:cite2:citeusnatarch:declindep.engraving:")
original_pages = Cite2Urn("urn:cite2:citeusnatarch:declindep.original:")
```

::: callout-tip
## Learn more about [citation with `Cite2Urn`s](../cite/urns/cite2.qmd)
:::

### Citing images

Identify documentary images for the front of the parchment and the first page of the engraving using `Cite2Urn`s.

```{julia}
#| output: false
original_img1 = Cite2Urn("urn:cite2:citeusnatarch:declindep.v1:Declaration_Pg1of1_AC")
engraving_img1 = Cite2Urn("urn:cite2:citeusnatarch:declindep.v1:Declaration_Engrav_Pg1of1_AC")
```

## Digital texts

### Orthography

Define an orthographic system for the texts we will read.

```{julia}
#| output: false
using Orthography
ortho = simpleAscii()
```

### Create citable texts

Read the XML source from a URL, and make the marked up content accessible through canonical citation with the `CitableTeiReaders` package.

```{julia}
using CitableTeiReaders
engraving_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/quart-home/main/walkthrough/adoi/declaration_engraving.xml"
engraving_corpus = readcitable(engraving_url, engraving_text, TEIAnonblock, UrlReader)
```

Compose a univocal diplomatic edition from the multivalent XML document.

```{julia}
using EditionBuilders
builder = MidDiplomaticBuilder("Diplomatic edition buidler", "dipl")
engraving_dipl = edited(builder, engraving_corpus)
```

### A full digital scholarly edition

### Relations of text, artifact and image

```{julia}
using CitablePhysicalText
```

#### Services for images

- configure HMT image service



## Application: explore differences in the texts visually

- computationally identify sections where texts differ
- show image of section, linked to ICT
- manually use the Homer Multitext project's Image Citation Tool to zoom in to  more specific region of interest and cite it with a URN. Here we save references to the region of two images illustrating the word "Happiness."

```{julia}
happiness_engraving = Cite2Urn("urn:cite2:citeusnatarch:declindep.v1:Declaration_Engrav_Pg1of1_AC@0.4672,0.1935,0.07188,0.01804")
happiness_original = Cite2Urn("urn:cite2:citeusnatarch:declindep.v1:Declaration_Pg1of1_AC@0.4765,0.1892,0.07596,0.01857")
```


## Application: organize differences in the texts as a sequence alignment

```{julia}
using VectorAlignments
delimited_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/quart-home/main/walkthrough/adoi/declaration.cex"
dsetriples = fromcex(delimited_url, DSECollection, UrlReader)
```
